# task_initializer
A command line utility to copy a template directory structure from one location to another. 

## Installation

### Create Template Directories
Navigate to `C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.task_initializer`. If that folder does not already exist, create it, or run the task_intializer for the first time, which will create the folder for you. Within that folder, create a subfolder named `default`.

Lay out the `default` template however you would like. You can create other templates, but the default is the one that will be most readily accessible. I laid mine out as follows.

### Add to Path (Optional, But Recommended)
Add the init_task executable location to your [Windows PATH variable]([url](https://windowsloop.com/how-to-add-to-windows-path/)) to call it from any location. 

## Usage
After creating a template directory and adding the executable to the PATH, navigate to a directory in which you would like to initialize a task. 


## Help
Type `init_task --help` for help.
